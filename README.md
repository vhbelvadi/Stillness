# Stillness
Stillness is a minimal and clean Wordpress theme based on zh2.

### About
Years ago @leobabauta released the Zen Habits theme which I really liked for its minimal approach and style. In 2013, he released v2.0 and now, three years later, I decided to rework it. This reworking was in two parts: design and functionality. Specifically, the original zh2 theme required the user to dive into the code to make certain changes to get the theme to work as expected. **Stillness** does away with that by ensuring that everything can be done from the Wordpress admin menu following some simple set-up instructions.

### Demo
There is a demo site set up [here](http://stillness.vhbelvadi.com), installation instructions are available [here](http://vhbelvadi.com/stillness-theme#instructions), I can be found [here](http://vhbelvadi.com) and Leo Babauta should be somewhere [here](http://zenhabits.net).
