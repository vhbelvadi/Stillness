# Stillness
Stillness is a minimal and clean Wordpress theme based on zh2.

### About
Years ago @leobabauta released the Zen Habits theme which I really liked for its minimal approach and style. In 2013, he released v2.0 and now, three years later, I decided to rework it. This reworking was in two parts: design and functionality. Specifically, the original zh2 theme required the user to dive into the code to make certain changes to get the theme to work as expected. **Stillness** does away with that by ensuring that everything can be done from the Wordpress admin menu following some simple set-up instructions.

### Demo
There is a demo site set up [here](http://stillness.vhbelvadi.com), installation instructions are available [here](http://vhbelvadi.com/stillness-theme#instructions), I can be found [here](http://vhbelvadi.com) and Leo Babauta should be somewhere [here](http://zenhabits.net).

Also used in version 2.0 of this theme is responsive-nav.js by @viljamis which can be found [here](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js).

### To-do and other notes
1. ~~Secondary menu is not responsive and will probably never be.~~ Both menus are now responsive.
2. Responsive main menu (only, not the secondary "social" menu) has fixed positioning on mobile devices. Most users will never notice this, so it's not exactly a high priority issue.
