<a id="close-your-eyes" class="anchor" href="#close-your-eyes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Close your eyes</h3>

<p>Years ago <a href="https://github.com/leobabauta" class="user-mention">@leobabauta</a> released the Zen Habits theme which I really liked for its minimal approach and style. In 2013, he released v2.0 and now, three years later, I decided to rework it. This reworking was in two parts: design and functionality. Specifically, the original z2h theme required the user to dive into the code to make certain changes to get the theme to work as expected. <strong>Stillness</strong> does away with that by ensuring that everything can be done from the Wordpress admin menu following some simple set-up instructions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="stay-still" class="anchor" href="#stay-still" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stay still</h3>

<p>This theme stays true to the original version, being minimal, and comes with a great deal of stylistic changes.
Functional changes include moving archival links to the footer<sup>1</sup>, h1 tagging post titles for better SEO, improved CSS classes, a better HTML structure, support for Wordpress Menus and, in what is perhaps the biggest fork off the spirit of the original theme, there is exactly <em>one</em> option that lets users pick an accent colour of their choice to be used for links.</p>

<p><s>Also, the archival link on the original theme has been changed to regular Wordpress pagination because it was one of the features that required the user to change bits of code. I'm hoping to bring back the feature in a later version of this theme if I can think of a way to make it work using just Wordpress</s><sup>2</sup>. <strong>Update:</strong> Done. The archival link now works almost exactly as on z2h with one difference: in order to keep things minimal, it cascades all previous posts without monthly separation.</p>

<p>Lastly, pages and posts have different archival links and, rather intelligently, the archival link is not displayed on the archival page. Also, single post pages (neither archives nor the front page) will carry the author's byline.</p>

<h3>
<a id="breathe-deep" class="anchor" href="#breathe-deep" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Breathe deep</h3>

<p>I may update this theme in the future. Since it uses Google Fonts, you should have no support to get the theme looking <em>exactly</em> as you see on the <a href="http://stillness.vhbelvadi.com">demo site</a>. No support will be provided. However, installation <a href="http://vhbelvadi.com/stillness">instructions are available</a> and I have set up a <a href="http://stillness.vhbelvadi.com">demo site</a> so you can see exactly how things will work. I usually reply to all e-mails, so if you really have to, do <a href="http://vhbelvadi.com/contact">get in touch</a> with me.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> This allows users to have more than one post showing, because the original theme only allowed one post to show â€” this can be undone by setting your blog to show only one post.</p>
